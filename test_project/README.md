Open Exoplanet Catalogue - Web Front End
==============

This repository contains a front end for the [Open Exoplanet Catalogue](https://github.com/hannorein/open_exoplanet_catalogue). It used the [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) javascript library to create dynamical websites using the Open Exoplanet Catalogue

The Open Exoplanet Catalogue is a database of all discovered extra-solar planets. New planets are usually added within 24 hours of their announcement.

The open exoplanet catalogue and this front end are licensed under an MIT license (see below), which basically says you can do everything with it. If you use either of them for a scientific publication, please include a reference to the Open Exoplanet Catalogue on [github](https://github.com/hannorein/open_exoplanet_catalogue) or to [this arXiv paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.7121).  

This front end is maintained by Hanno Rein, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton. However, I hope this will become a community project. Please send corrections and additions via pull request or [email](mailto:exoplanet@hanno-rein.de). If you have questions or comments about git or the database, please do not hesitate to contact me directly.
